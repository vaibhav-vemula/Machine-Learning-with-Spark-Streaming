# Machine Learning with Spark Streaming

### Machine Learning with Spark MLlib is taken up as a part of the UE19CS322 Big Data course at PES University. 
This simulates a real world scenario where you will be required to handle an enormous amount of data for predictive modelling. The data source is a stream and  application faces the constraint of only being able to handle batches of a stream at any given point in time.
