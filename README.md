# Machine Learning with Spark Streaming


### Machine Learning with Spark MLlib is taken up as a part of the UE19CS322 Big Data course at PES University. 
This simulates a real world scenario where you will be required to handle an enormous amount of data for predictive modelling. 
The data source is a stream and  application faces the constraint of only being able to handle batches of a stream at any given point in time.


### Selected Dataset -
- San Francisco Crime Classification
    - Each crime is a single vector of size 9
    - The label or category is the second feature
    - 878k records in train and test dataset
